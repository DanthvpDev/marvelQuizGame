# Welcome to Pokemon Trivia Game üëãüèΩ  
  
This project was made using ![React Native](https://img.shields.io/badge/react_native-%2320232a.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=%2361DAFB) and ![Expo](https://img.shields.io/badge/expo-1C1E24?style=for-the-badge&logo=expo&logoColor=#D04A37).  
This is a trivia game where you can guess the pokemon shown on screen. You will be able to get a list of pokemons shown as cards on the characters window. This cards includes the pokemon's name and the abilities it has. ü§ì    
  
## Environment configuration  
This app is only available on ![Android](https://img.shields.io/badge/Android-3DDC84?style=for-the-badge&logo=android&logoColor=white) as an APK.  
For ![iOS](https://img.shields.io/badge/iOS-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=ios&logoColor=white) you must install ![Expo](https://img.shields.io/badge/expo-1C1E24?style=for-the-badge&logo=expo&logoColor=#D04A37) Go app. Download the ![NPM](https://img.shields.io/badge/NPM-%23CB3837.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=npm&logoColor=white) modules and use the command `npm start` on a command line. Then you could scan the QR Code to start using it or use the Android Studio Emulator.  
  
## Devolpment Decisions  
### Tanstack Query usage (former ![React Query](https://img.shields.io/badge/-React%20Query-FF4154?style=for-the-badge&logo=react%20query&logoColor=white))  
Tanstack Query was a great decision to manage the API requests.  
This is an usual response from Pokemons PokeAPI endpoint [https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon](https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon):

```  
Each result has its own URL where you can find a vast amount of information about the pokemon, including its abilities, species, diet, and so on. ü§Ø  
The big problem is that each pokemon URL depends on the state of each request to [https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon](https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon). Using Tanstack Query this complex problem became a simple task. By using the enabled atribute on the Pokemon Request hook, you can wait until the first request finshes to start with the new one. This approach helped to make the development process smoother, easier to understand and improved the code readability. üëçüèΩüë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª
